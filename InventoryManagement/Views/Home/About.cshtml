    <ul>
        <li>All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item</li>
        <li>All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is</li>
        <li>At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item</li>
        <li>Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast</li>
        <li>The Quality of an item is never negative</li>
        <li>The Quality of an item is never more than 50</li>
        <li>"Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets</li>
        <li>“Frozen Item” decreases in Quality by 1</li>
        <li>"Soap" never has to be sold or decreases in Quality</li>
        <li>
            "Christmas Crackers", like “Aged Brie”, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches; Its
            quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less
            but quality drops to 0 after Christmas
        </li>
        <li>"Fresh Item" degrade in Quality twice as fast as “Frozen Item”</li>
    </ul>
